Data and code for Lost Opportunity analysis, as published in J. Appl. Ecology

Manuscript: Smith et al (accepted) "Lost opportunity: quantifying the dynamic economic impact of time-area fishery closures" Journal of Applied Ecology

Data: 1) A set of rasters representing the predicted swordfish CPUE for every day of two fishing seasons. These rasters are used in the R code to calculate Lost Economic Opportunity for these two seasons.
2) Pre-calculated locations of ports, swordfish prices, etc, as RDS files.

Code: An R script to calculate Lost Economic Opportunity
